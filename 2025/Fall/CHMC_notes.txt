Currently working on updating the CHMC.ipynb to AVF:FPI

To do:
0) grad_q_H = -\del pi(q)/pi(q) *
1) Implement AVF
2) Implement CHMC via FPI
3) Consolidate the HMC code by removing redundant experiments
4) Speed up code by removing jax.random.split() evals into a single vector

Possible to pass numpy array for p0 draws

Philosophy: If we only use jax for grad, don't re-write whole code in jax

look up multinorm determiniant for correction coefficient of gaussian
